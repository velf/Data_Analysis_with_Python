  "body": "## Prerequisites: \r\nBasic programming skills in any programming language (e.g. /R, Stata, SPSS, Matlab/ familiarity with logical statements, for loops, with different variables), Basic statistics\r\nCourse Level: Master\r\n\r\n## Brief Introduction:\r\nThis course provides a  basic introduction to data analysis with python for social scientists. Students expected to attend classes, be proactive and ask questions and hack their homeworks at home and create a final project based on the given tutorials and hands-on sessions.\r\n\r\n## Aim of the course:\r\nProviding enough programming experience and tutorials for students to be able to start working with python in data analysis and social scientific research. This course tends to be a good foundation from which new tools, techniques and the beautiful world of open-source development can be explored later on.\r\n\r\n## Grading:\r\n* Assignment - 20%\r\n* Final Project (Code and Presentation)- 60% \r\n* Attendance and in-class activity - 20%\r\n\r\nIn classes students required to bring their own laptops, and please be sure that both the Anaconda python work environment and Internet works on it, before the first class. Find here the setup instructions. Internet is essential because programming is most of the time mainly about googling for the relevant information/bug/package. \r\nEach class organized by two 90 minutes sessions, with a 15 minutes break. The first part of the class is about introducing new tools, the second one is practicing it with individual or group-work.\r\n\r\n## Resources: \r\n* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - the python work environment that we will use. Find here the setup instructions.\r\n* [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - always handy for programming help\r\n* [Learning python, 5th edition](http://www.allitebooks.com/learning-python-5th-edition/), the [Python standard library](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html) , the [Python.org tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).\r\n* More resources: [Python for Data Analysis](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~embat/Python%20for%20Data%20Analysis.pdf), [Learn Python on a Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)\r\n* Cannot wait to start our class? Go to [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) and learn the basics!\r\n\r\nSyllabus:\r\n\r\n*Install Python on your own computer, and make sure it works, before the first class. *\r\n\r\n1. Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebook, variables, data structures (strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, functions, loops)\r\n2. String Operations and Web Scraping (BKK, WIkipedia)\r\n3. Reading and Writing Files, File Parsing (FB timeline parsing)\r\n4. Twitter API and Data Visualization with Matplotlib\r\n5. Data Analysis with Pandas I.\r\n6. Data Analysis with Pandas II. (Linear regression analysis)\r\n7. Machine Learning (hands-on) (PCA, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree), HW: Send your final Project Plan to me!\r\n8. Introduction to Network ANalysis (NetworkX, Bokeh)\r\n9. Final Project Presentations - mid november\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any question or comment regarding course materials [contact me](mailto:orsolya.vasarhelyi@gmail.co).\r\n",
